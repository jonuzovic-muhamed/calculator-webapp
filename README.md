## About
This project is part of the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>'s foundations course, which I undertook in order to increase my knowledge in modern web development.

For this project it was neecessary to create a simple calculator web-application using the HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge learned in prior lessons.
